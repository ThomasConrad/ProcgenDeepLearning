# REGULARIZATION AND MULTI-TASK AGENTS IN PROCEDURAL VIDEO GAMES
This code repository contains the work performed by Thomas R. S. Conrad (s183742) and Kristian S. Knudsen (s183779) in the course 02456 Deep learning, DTU Compute of Fall 2020.

## Requirements
To run this repository, python 3 is required. The required packages are:
* Torch
* Procgen
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
## Instructions
To run our code and pretrained models use the unified notebook. This requires an Nvidia GPU to run and for the regularizer and multi task experiments it requires a lot of VRAM to run.
